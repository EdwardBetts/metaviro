Using R we determined that a 5-mers SVM RBF 100-PCA yielded a kappa of 0.67 over a 15-NN
SVM parameters were sigma=0.0125 (1/80) and C=20 

* We validate this results using python 
* We then determine which choice of combinations of 
k neighbors
num dim to kepp
sigma
C 
would yield the best SVM classifier 


We then determine if supervised dimension reduction techniques could provide better performances
and if this classifier could be used on an totally independent dataset
